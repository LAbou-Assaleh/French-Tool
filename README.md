# French Assistant

French Assistant is a tool designed to assist with the translation and conjugation of French words and verbs. It is an easy-to-use program, especially useful for language learners who are trying to improve their proficiency in French.

## Usage

To use the program, you need to have an OpenAI API key. Once you have obtained an API key, you can input it in the `creds.py` file in place of the text. Remember to put the key in quotation marks.

Once the program is opened, the user will be presented with two options: "Noun" and "Verb". Selecting "Noun" allows the user to input any French phrase which will be translated into English. If "Verb" is selected, the user may input one French verb and select the tense they wish to conjugate it in.

## Features

- **Translation**: French Assistant can translate French words and phrases into English.
- **Conjugation**: French Assistant can conjugate French verbs in various tenses and moods, including present, past, future, conditional, and infinitive.

## Limitations

While French Assistant can be a useful tool for language learners, it is important to note that it is not perfect. The translations and conjugations generated by the program may not always be accurate or idiomatic. It is always a good idea to double-check the results with a reliable reference, such as a dictionary or grammar book.
